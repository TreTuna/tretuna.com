This is the new, very under construction, home for all things Tre Tuna, otherwise
known as Tre Ammatuna. Seattle based software developer, partner, and father.
I'm currently helping my family as we added a new little girl to the mix and are
enjoying some time with her and her brothers. However, I hope to make this a place
where I can pursue my passions of development of not only myself, but those around
me, in an open and public fashion. I hope to help you in some way in the future.

Warm regards,

Tre Ammatuna
